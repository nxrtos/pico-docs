# This is a quick notes for working picoprobe with oppenocd and gdb

## raspberry pi pico itself can work as a SWD debugger. 
## There is an implementation picoprobe, using 
	GP2 	SWCLK
	GP3 	SWDIO
	GND 	GND

## It is possible to provide power supply from picoprobe debuger pico.
## from 
	VBUS (pin_40) 		# [source from USB input]
## to
	VSYS (pin_39) 		# [range 1.8V to 5.5V]

## start gdb server by 
  sudo openocd -f interface/picoprobe.cfg -f target/rp2040.cfg
   
## check other scripts from
  ls /usr/local/share/openocd/

## start gdb client by 
  gdb-multiarch

### gdb commands
	# target connect
	(gdb) target remote localhost:3333
